<h2 align="center">Full Stack Web Developer</h2>

<body>
  <p>I am a committed individual, looking to pursue a new career in web development. I have completed a web development course with Le Wagon. Where I learnt a range of languages that allowed me to develop my ability in front end and back end development to build a complete page from beginning to end. Such as in our final Le Wagon project Sports Companion which was built from scratch. Throughout this project we used: Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML, JS and others.

I also bring a diverse range of transferable skills from being Former Head of Activities within Hospitality sector. I am skilled in customer service, programme and event management, training and mentoring, sports coaching, and time management. I am a calm and composed individual, able to handle incidents and issues without worry. I have a strong sense of community and have obtained a Bachelor of Science (BSc) focused in Sport & Exercise Science from Edinburgh Napier University.
